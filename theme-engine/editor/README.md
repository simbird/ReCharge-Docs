# ReCharge Theme Editor
The ReCharge Theme Editor will allow you to customize the interface of your store's ReCharge Customer Portal. This portal is a series of pages and controls that allow your customers to view or modify their subscription, change their billing information, or review their order history. With the editor, you'll be able to tailor the look and feel of this portal to fit your store's style and branding.

## Checklist

To get started with the Theme Editor in the Alpha phase, please review the following requirements:

* **Contact at ReCharge** - Currently, the Theme editor feature is on an invite-only basis. Get in touch with our support team so we can set you up with a call and get you started.
* **Theme Editor enabled on store** - The theme editor must be manually enabled on your store. You must have an active Shopify store to use it.
* **Invite to Slack channel** - During the Alpha phase, we have a public slack channel you can be invited to where limited support can be provided for the theme engine.

**Important:** We do not provide design, customization, or development assistance for custom theme code.

# Themes
Themes are a collection of template files and assets that control the apperance of your customer portal. Using our Theme Editor, you'll be able to manage multiple themes, switch between them, build your own, or edit an existing one.

## The theme list
By default, your store will be pre-installed with a pre-built theme. This theme will have a pretty standard presentation of what we feel covers most customer needs, including pages to review their subscribed products, manage them, add new or cancel existing subscriptions, as well as an order/delivery schedule, order history, and billing tools.

**1.** From the theme list, find the theme you wish to preview.
**2.** Click on the gear icon for the associated theme.

You will need to publish your theme before your customers can use it. The publish theme link will activate the selected theme, making it live for your customers.

Now that your theme is published, the only way to un-publish the theme is by publishing another one.

Customizing a theme is the primary feature of the Theme editor. It will allow you to tweak or completely rebuild the Customer Portal. Using Liquid code, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you'll be able to control the look and feel of your customer's experience.

**1.** From the theme list, find the theme you wish to publish.
**2.** Click on the gear icon for the associated theme.
**3.** Click the **Edit code** link.

This will take you to the code editor window for the theme, revealing the theme files, a code window, and additional controls depending on template file.

![](http://host.coreycapetillo.com/github/theme/90-code-editor.png)

See the [Code editor](#code-editor) part of this documentation for details on how to use the code editor and its features.

**1.** From the theme list, find the theme you wish to publish.

# Code editor

The code editor window will allow you to edit the files that make up the Customer Portal theme. Using a combination of Liquid, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can customize the look and feel of your customer's subscription management pages.

Extensive documentation for the various data objects you have access to, as well as a complete reference of available routes (URLs) and data filters, visit our [Developer documentation]().

![](http://host.coreycapetillo.com/github/theme/90-code-editor.png)

The following guides will give you an overview of the available tools for working with theme files.

## Theme files

The theme files list will show you the templates that make up your Customer Portal theme, as well as give you the ability to create new files.

![](http://host.coreycapetillo.com/github/theme/120-theme-files.png)

Clicking on a file name will load it into the code window, allowing you to review, edit, rename or delete your file.

## Add new file

Adding a new file will allow you to create a file that will allow you to organize your theme's code into more manageable parts. Reference our [Developer documentation]() for information on how to include a file into another template.

**1.** Locate the bottom of the **Theme files** list
**2.** Click the **Add new file** link.

![](http://host.coreycapetillo.com/github/theme/190-code-editor-new-file-modal.png)

![](http://host.coreycapetillo.com/github/theme/190-code-editor-new-file-modal.png)

After confirming the name of your new file, the page will reload with the new file active in the code window.

## Preview

The preview button will launch a new window with a URL parameter (`preview_theme=<theme.id>`) that will allow you to preview your theme without having to publish it.

You must save any existing changes if you wish to preview them.

If the page you're trying to preview is attached to a route (URL), such as `subscription.html` or `customer.html`, the preview window will automatically deliver you to that associated URL.

## Code window

While the code window can't replace a full-featured IDE, it is an excellent replacement, especially for users who are familair with the Shopify code editor.

![](http://host.coreycapetillo.com/github/theme/150-code-window.png)

The code editor allows for HTML and Liquid code. With acceptance of HTML, that means you can also use CSS and JavaScript, as long as they're wrapped in the required encapsulating tags: `<style>...</style>` and `<script>...</script>`.

##### The code window features:

* Syntax highlighting
* Code folding
* Tag and bracket matching
* Active-line highlighting
* Searching (CTRL+F / CMD+F)
* CTRL+S / CMD+S to save
* Liquid validation on save

## Save

Saving a file will dedicate your changes. If you are editing a published theme, the changes will be immediately reflected on the customer portal and available to your users.

**1.** Locate the asset controls in the corner of the code window.
**2.** Click the **Save** link.

![](http://host.coreycapetillo.com/github/theme/130-save-button.png)

Once you save a file, you'll see a notification alerting you that the asset has been saved.

![](http://host.coreycapetillo.com/github/theme/140-save-notification.png)

**Tip:** You can also use CTRL+S on Windows (or CMD+S on a Mac) to quickly save your file.


## File controls

Non-essential files in the **Theme list** will have a gear icon at the corner of the code window, which will give you the ability to rename or delete the file.

![](http://host.coreycapetillo.com/github/theme/200-code-editor-settings-menu.png)

This will be located in the corner of the code window.

## Rename

Renaming a file is only allowed for non-essential files tied to a route (URL). You cannot templates such as `subscriptions.html` or `delivery_schedule.html`.

**1.** Locate the asset controls in the corner of the code window.
**2.** Click the gear icon to expand the menu.
**3.** Click the **Rename** link.

![](http://host.coreycapetillo.com/github/theme/220-rename-menu-link.png)

# Rollout and Reversion

Once you're satisfied with the changes you've made to the Customer Portal, you can begin displaying the customized pages to a percentage of your new customers. Navigate to the Customer Portal controls from the settings dropdown menu. From here, you'll be able to choose between the "Standalone page on ReCharge" portal (ReCharge branded), the "Storefront" portal (ReCharge layout with your store's CSS), and the new "Storefront - Theme Editor" portal (your customized portal).

## Rollout

When you check "Storefront - Theme Editor", a field will appear that allows you to set the percentage of new customers who will see the Theme editor customized portal. We suggest starting with a low percentage and increasing it over time.

## Reversion

If you notice an issue with your new portal, you can easily revert back by selecting "Storefront" or "Standalone page on ReCharge". This will revert all customers back—even those that saw the new portal.

## Reviewing Customers on the New Portal

We'll be introducing ways to better filter your customer list and easily access the customers with the new portal design. You'll be able to easily check how their portals display and reach out to them for feedback.
