#### Old documentation:

Currently in `BETA`, the Theme Engine will be an update to the Customer Portal which will allow you to completely customize the pages their customers use to manage their subscription beyond simply adding HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

You'll have access to use liquid code and an array of objects and filters like Shopify and create a truly unique, personal, and branded experience.

## The widget

The Subscription Widget is the first point of contact many of your customers will encounter ReCharge. The challenge for the widget is getting it to function against an endless sea of variables, including theme types, browser versions, and plugins.

We've built the widget to look as good as possible on as many different configurations, but we still allow an wide amount of customizability and ways to override options in case the installation doesn't go as expected.
